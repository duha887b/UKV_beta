# UKV - Universal Konvugal Visualizer

## Overview
The UKV (Universal Konvugal Visualizer) is a powerful analysis tool designed for precise visualization and data analysis. This project integrates G-Code parsing and CSV data processing to visualize and synchronize measurement data, 
allowing users to accurately map and analyze measurements along a G-Code path. The application is built using Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and Plotly for advanced plotting capabilities.

## Features
- **G-Code Parsing**: Efficiently reads and processes G-Code files to extract X and Y coordinates.
- **CSV Data Processing**: Reads measurement data from CSV files, synchronizing it with the G-Code coordinates.
- **2D and 3D Plotting**: Visualizes the G-Code path and measurement data in both 2D and 3D plots using Plotly.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to load files, select plot modes, and configure settings easily.
- **Automation**: Includes a batch script to run the application in a virtual environment, ensuring all dependencies are managed.

## Installation
To set up the UKV, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Unzip**:
    - Download the `UKV_beta_xx.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/duha887b/UKV_beta/releases) section.
    - Unzip the contents to a desired location on your Windows machine.

2. **Run the Batch Script**:
    - Navigate to the unzipped folder.
    - Double-click `start_program.bat` to activate the virtual environment and start the application.

## Usage
1. **Load Files**: Use the GUI to load your G-Code and CSV files.
2. **Select Plot Mode**: Choose between 2D G-Code plot, 3D G-Code plot, or Time plot.
3. **Configure Settings**: Specify the number of points to display and whether to open the plot in a browser.
4. **Generate Plot**: Click 'Generate Plot' to visualize your data.
